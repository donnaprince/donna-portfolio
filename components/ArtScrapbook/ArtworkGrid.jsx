Historically practiced by the Rabari community to decorate the interior walls of their homes, the art originally used a mixture of clay and camel dung for durability. Modern adaptations often replace camel dung with adhesives like Fevicryl for cleaner, longer-lasting results. The embedded mirrors are believed to ward off evil spirits and reflect light, brightening interiors in arid regions. Today, Lippan art is celebrated both as cultural heritage and as a contemporary decorative medium."
